# DigiShow JavaScript Expression Reference
 
JS expression is a formula that can dynamically change the value of a signal. The following variables and functions can be used in the expression written in JavaScript syntax. 
 
 
## Common variables in expressions
 
**value** 
The original value of this signal before the expression is calculated. 
 
**range** 
The maximum value of this signal in the range. 
 
**lastValue** 
The last value stored in this signal after the expression is calculated. 
 
 
## Common functions in expressions
 
**inputValueOf(name)** 
Get the input value of the signal link bar with the title _name_ . 
 
**outputValueOf(name)** 
Get the output value of the signal link bar with the title _name_ . 
 
**alert(message)** 
Display an information dialog box with the text _message_, and close it after pressing the "OK" button. 
 
**toast(message)** 
Display a notification prompt box with the text _message_, which will automatically disappear after staying for a few seconds. 

An expression can also contain multiple statements, and the statements need to be separated by ; semicolons. The last statement is used to return the value calculated by the expression. For example: 
_alert("value = " + value); value_ 
  
In addition, there are more functions that can be called in expressions and the attached script file of DigiShow projects. 
 
 
## More functions
 
**setOutputValueOf(name, value)** 
Change the output value of the signal link bar with the title _name_ to _value_. Returns true if the call succeeds, false if it fails. 
 
**appVersion()** 
Returns the DigiShow application version number string. 
 
**appFilePath(filename)** 
Returns the absolute path of the file named _filename_ in the directory where the DigiShow project file is located. 
 
**appDataPath(filename)** 
Returns the absolute path of the file named _filename_ in the DigiShow configuration data directory. 
 
(For more that can be called in JS scripts, see the functions marked with Q_INVOKABLE in the digishow_environment.h header file) 
 
 
## Functions of the app object
 
**app.elapsed()**
Returns the elapsed time in milliseconds since the project was started.
 
**app.restart()** 
Restart the current DigiShow project. 
 
**app.startLaunch(name)** 
Start the specified preset (launch) item, the parameter _name_ can usually be 'launch1', 'launch2', 'launch3' ... 
 
(For more about the app object that can be called in JS scripts, see the functions marked with Q_INVOKABLE in the digishow_app.h header file) 
 
 
## Functions of the utilities object
 
**utilities.runInShell(program, arguments)** 
Run the program program in the operating system shell, and specify the various parameters of the program in the array arguments.
For example: _utilities.runInShell('shutdown', ['-f', '-s', '-t', '0'])_ 
It is equivalent to running _shutdown -f -s -t 0_ in the command line. 

**utilities.httpRequest(url)**
Invoke an http request to the target _url_ with the GET method and obtain the content returned by the server. 
 
**utilities.httpRequest(url, method, contents, timeout)** 
Invoke an http request to the target _url_ with the GET / POST / PUT method and obtain the content returned by the server. 
Parameter _method_ can be 'get', 'post' or 'put'. 
Parameter _contents_ is the data content posted or put to the http server. 
Parameter _timeout_ is in milliseconds. When the timeout of waiting for the http request reply is exceeded, the function will return an empty string. 
 
**utilities.delay(timeout)** 
The program pauses for a specific time and then continues after the timeout. The parameter _timeout_ is in milliseconds. During the pause, the DigiShow main program remains active and signals are sent and received normally.

## Properties of the metronome object
 
The metronome object can be used to implement various controls on the beat maker. 
 
**metronome.isRunning** 
The running status of the beat maker, the value can be true or false, this property is readable and writable. 
 
**metronome.isSoundEnabled** 
Whether the beat maker makes a sound when it beats, the value can be true or false, this property is readable and writable. 
 
**metronome.isLinkEnabled** 
Whether the beat maker keeps the beat synchronization with other software that supports the Ableton Link interface, the value can be true or false, this property is readable and writable. 
 
**metronome.bpm** 
The tempo status of the beat maker, the bpm value is used to mark the number of beats per minute, this property is readable and writable. 
 
**metronome.quantum** 
The number of beats per measure of the beat maker, the default is 4, this property is readable and writable. 
 
**metronome.beat** 
The current total beat count of the running beat maker, this property is read-only. 
 
**metronome.phase** 
The number of beats in the current measure of the running beat maker, such as: 1, 2, 3, 4. This property is read-only.
