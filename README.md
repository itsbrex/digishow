DigiShow is a lightweight cross-media control software designed for live performances and interactive art installations. It provides an intuitive console interface that enables signal control and mapping among various audio, lighting, robotic, and interactive devices. 

- **Digital Artists:** Create cross-media interactive art installations 
- **Stage & Immersive Designers:** Program cues to synchronize lighting, mechanical devices, and music 
- **Musicians:** Enhance live performances with DIY electronic instruments or automated lighting 
- **Engineers & Makers:** Develop smart interactive projects like home automations 


## Key Features

- **Multi-Protocol Support** 

	Supports MIDI, DMX, OSC, Modbus, Arduino, Hue, and other protocols for coordinated control of audio, lighting, screens, robotics, and more. 

- **Signal Mapping**

	Converts MIDI notes, OSC control signals, etc., into lighting, servo motor, and media playback commands. Also transforms sensor inputs into MIDI/OSC signals for music software (e.g., Ableton Live, Logic Pro) and real-time visual creative tools (e.g., TouchDesigner, Unreal Engine). 

- **Interactive Control** 

	Ideal for DJ performances, stage or space lighting synchronization, experimental music, and interactive installations to enhance live engagement and visual effects. 

For a typical 'digital' show, requires some particular digital things working together, along with DigiShow LINK.

## Technologies and Functions

- **No-Coding Arduino** 

	Provides a ready-to-use sketch drives mapping sensors and actuators connected to Arduino as inputs and outputs used directly in the DigiShow. 

- **Cue Player** 

	Features a graphical interface for designing output curves for specific scenarios, which can be attached to presets for synchronized playback. 

- **Pixel Mapping** 

	Dynamically maps video or image pixels to lighting arrays for visual effects. 

- **Scripting Support** 

	Allows JavaScript/QML expressions and scripts for advanced interactive logic. 

- **Network Protocols** 

	Supports OSC and pipes over WebSocket for external extensions, as well as Art-Net for large-scale lighting control systems.

## DigiShow for Beginners

1. **Configure Interfaces:** 

	Set up control interfaces (e.g., MIDI, DMX, Arduino) for audio, lighting, and interactive devices in the Interface Manager. 

2. **Create Signal Links:** 

	Add signal bars in the Signal Link Table and assign specific outputs to them, where adjust output values in real time using faders. 

3. **Save Scenes:** 

	Save output values in the grouped signal bars as Presets for specific scenarios. Store timeline-based signal output curves in the Cue Player. 

4. **Switch Scenes (Manual):** 

	Activate the saved Presets and Cue Players by tapping the buttons in the Preset Launcher or a remote web page in another smart phone. 

5. **Trigger Scenes (Automatic):** 

	Alternatively, connects scene switching to specific sensor triggers, by selecting the sensors as inputs and Presets as outputs in the signal bars. 

With these steps, you can build a live audio-visual control console or an interactive art installation.
