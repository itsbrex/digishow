There is an OSC server for controlling lights, IP address: 127.0.0.1, port: 8000

OSC addresses:
/red	Controls red light brightness (value range 0 to 1.0)
/green	Controls green light brightness (value range 0 to 1.0)
/blue	Controls blue light brightness (value range 0 to 1.0)
/white	Controls white light brightness (value range 0 to 1.0)

Please use Python language to control the lights:
- Create a 10-second light animation that plays in a loop
- RGB three colors alternately appear with smooth gradients
- White light flashes every 2 seconds
